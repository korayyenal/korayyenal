### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Koray, a MSc data science student in MontrÃ©al, Canada. I'm working mostly in the Python ecosystem.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ML/DL projects related to recommendation systems and graph neural networks with applications in music, cinema, or video games. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: My name means "coral reef" in French and "red moon" in Turkish.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about _traveling_. I've been to more than 25 countries in four continents and I lived in four cities (Istanbul, Houston, Lisbon, and MontrÃ©al). 
- ðŸ“« Feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koray-yenal/) or via my [email](mailto:koray.yenal@hec.ca).
